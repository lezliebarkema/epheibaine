Does anyone know if it would be possible for me to use a generic wireless controller (https://www.gpdxd.com/product/usb-2-0-wireless-vibration-controller-gamepad-for-gpd-xd/) with the PSClassic and retroarch? The controller seems to pair with the dongle once the system is powered on, but doesn't function at all, nor does retroarch recognize it. I've tried both a powered and unpowered USB hub, and modified the retroarch config file to use the raw, dinput, and xinput drivers, though I don't. 23 ноя 2015  Данная проблема актуальна, как в Windows 7 и Windows 8, так и в Windows 10.  Либо же, если не помогло, воспользоваться онлайн версией Driver Pack  зайти в пункт «Generic USB Hub», «USB Root Controller». I recently bought a generic USB gamepad. But there is a big problem with the joystick, and I've search everywhere about a workaround or a driver, or something like this and I've found nothing. I expose my problem, we will name the left stick's axis , Ax1 Ay1 and the right stick's axis Ax2 and Ay2. So when I push the right stick up or down everything works fine, Ax2 is at maximum or minimum. Same for the left stick. But when I push the left stick to left Ax1 and Ax2 is at minimum I am wondering if anyone has gotten a custom arcade stick with the Zero Delay usb encoder to work with Retroarch on the SNES mini. My Snes mini is running latest version of Retroach and is recognising all sorts of devices including HORI fightpads, PS3 controllers with the default udev driver but this custom arcade stick is not showing. The Zero Delay is supposed to work with the Raspberry Pi Retropie which I assume is fairly similar to the SNES mini Retroarch (correct me if im wrong).

So you heard that Steam can make your Dualshock 4 work with any PC game and you really want to try it out but it just isn't working out for some reason. Maybe you haven't even tried it yet and wanted a tutorial so you didn't run into any issue. Well this is exactly what you need! # Connecting your Dualshock to your PC There are three ways to do this: USB, Generic Bluetooth, and the Official Receiver (https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/accessories/gaming-controllers/dualshock-4-usb-wire.

I had a problem with my HDD, so had to replace it and install everything again. Downloaded Retroarch 1.7.5 (zip version) and started the program. It works, ROMs are being detected and loading on selected Cores. But i have problems with my Joystick configuration. My USB Joystick is a Generic brand, it from MB Tech (don't know if it exits outside of Brazil). And yes, it works, and always worked. It still works fine on Steam, and neved needed any Xinput converter.

I just bought a Thrustmaster Hotas 4 and Elite Dangerous; I'm completely new to both. I have downloaded the newest drivers/firmware for the Hotas, I have put this Hotas X binding file (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=178834&p=2757172#post2757172) in my correct Appdata folder, and I've verified that Generic Steam controllers is unchecked in Steam's Big Picture.

There’s been a lot of touched in this release, with improvements in a number of areas. But before we get to the improvements, we have an embarrassing admission to make: the game added in 0.185 as Acchi Muite Hoi is actually Pata Pata Panic, and the sound ROM mapping was incorrect, making the game unplayable.

Hi all, Been playing Elite since the beginning and a big fan of VR. VR support in Elite is pretty much the best out there. There is one small caveat with VR: you cannot see your joystick/keyboard or hands for that matter. I'm flying with a X52 HOTAS; It is a fantastic controller (and it matches the in-game model too) but some of the buttons on it are in a less than ideal place for VR use. Specifically the 3 keys on the right base; they are difficult to active in a hurry 
A friend of mine asked me for instructions on how to setup his GPD Win when he gets it so I have made a list of instructions based on my research. I thought I'd share them here. 1. Update to Windows Anniversary update (I personally don't believe a fresh install is necessary). It is Update 1607 and can be applied through the standard Windows Update procedure. 2. Run Disk Cleanup  select Clean up System Files  Put a tick next to everything then click OK. 3. Update to Latest. So, after a heartbreaking month of having a Surface Pro 3 that was utterly unstable and unusable, I now seem (emphasis on seem ) to have it completely stable and successfully running an instance of Linux Mint 18.2. Required Equipment ------------------ Here's all the things I did, probably in the order I did them. First: buy some stuff: A powered hub with at least four ports, a USB-to-Ethernet connection, and two 16GB USB memory sticks. If you want to preserve the installed Windows instance. So I recently tried to install the drivers in https://www.reddit.com/r/RivalsOfAether/comments/5v5af8/fixing_official_wiiu_adapter_problems/ so I could play Rivals of Aether, but ever since I downloaded it my generic twin usb joystick controller I use for other games hasn't been working properly. Does anybody have the drivers for it? All of the Youtube links and other links are suspect and don't work. EDIT: What I'm specifically asking for is what the drivers the installer replaced So my father just bought himself a new custom PC and I persuaded him to get elite dangerous (as he's a big scifi fan). He's been playing the tutorials for a couple of weeks (!) because of the anticipation of the arrival of his new T16000m FCS HOTAS. I bought the same stick and it worked straight away but for some reason we can't get it to work for him at all. A full summary of the issue follows: 1. The preset does not appear in the controls menu. All we have is Empty (no control My PC started acting up a couple of days ago. First it was just tiny hickups that lasted less than a second, like the stuff you get when you install a graphics card driver. The day before yesterday it started freaking out like this from time to time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IZPrt8CQh4 My first thought was that the GPU is busted, hence I threw my Radeon R390 out (still got warranty and Amazon refunds it, means free upgrade to XFX RX 580) and popped my old Radeon 6850 in until the repla.

I'd like to get PS2 emulation working perfectly. Everything seems to be fine but I'm not getting the controls to work well. Main issues are force feedback/vibration and button pressure sensitivity (necessary for MGS3 for example). I've got a real SCPH-10010 controller from a gaming store. I bought this adapter for it: They claim force feedback works though it doesn't appear I just purchased Arma 3, and wanted to use my old old Saitek Cyborg 3D Gold USB joystick with it. This thing is still in good shape, and just works with other games with the default drivers that Windows 10 installs for it. It is automatically detected as a CYBORG 3D USB, and I can go through the calibration in Windows without any issues. Though, when I start Arma 3, and go to Controllers, it isn't there. :( I tried setting it up as a generic gamepad in Steam Big Picture, which 
Hi everyone! I have two machines running Steam, one is Windows 10 x64 and another is running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I have a PS1/PS2 adapter Link to adapter (https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/For-Sony-PS1-PS2-Play-Station-2-Joypad-GamePad-to-PS3-PC-USB-Games-Controller-Adapter/32521537537.html?spm=2114.02010208.3.19.8waN9R&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_7_10065_10068_703_10136_10137_701_10060_10138_10062_10141_10056_10055_10054_301_10059_124_10099_10103_10102_10096_10144_10052_10053_10142. So after owning my Warthog HOTAS for several months I finally decided to run the Target software only to find that it doesn't work. I upgraded my system from Win7 64 to Win10 64 on an ASRock z97 Extreme4. Basically when I run the script, it times out and fails to create the composite device.( line 8 or line 6 errors) I have tried almost everything so far. Different usb ports, uninstalling all software, reinstalling drivers, uninstalling usb devices(hidden as well), updating firmware Hello. I searched many a forums and ran into multiple adware driver update thingies. So to elaborate on the title. It was working yesterday, and when I plugged in my joystick today it just says USB Device Descriptor failed. I thought my PCB broke but it still works/installs drivers on other pcs and ps3/ps4. Things I have tried are a uninstalling the device descriptor driver updating every single drive under "universal serial bus controllers" uninstalling every single drive under.

I have recently purchased a Windows compatible controller to play games on my PC. It is an @Play Game Controller XBOX 360 shaped controller. I have installed all drivers needed from the disc and plugged I use a playstions gamepad with a usb adaptor. I have installed various drivers, even then, every time I connect the gamepad, windows will use the generic usb joystick driver. The problem is, the generic joystick driver doesn't have vibration option, and my gamepad supports vibration. Is there a away to choose which driver to use? Or to add vibration to the options in the gamepad calibration. </p>
