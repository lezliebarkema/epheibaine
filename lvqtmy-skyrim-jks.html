Due to the issues that JK Skyrim has with Windhelm, I have removed the Skyrim version, and installed each of the individual town/city overhauls, except for the Windhelm one, which I have replaced with JK Lite. I'm now running into issues trying to include CFTO into the mix, as it only has patches for JK Skyrim, JK Towns and JK Cities, and I haven't been able to find the Towns or Cities versions. Has anyone made individual patches for the separate towns, or know of a patch out there that could.

Anyways so last week I had re-done all of my SSE mods and I mean from absolute scratch and of course, it hadn’t occurred to me to back up my old setup cause I’m dense. That aside I’ve now got some bizarre first-person rendering glitch where my arms appear bound whenever my weapons are holstered, now at first I had assumed I'd just messed up with JOP (Joy of perspective) no big deal so I went through my motions uninstalling, reinstalling, cleaning, etc. When that didn't work I started doing.

Hello dear Skyrim Modding Community, amp#x200B; Some weeks ago I started an SSE-playthrough with alot(?) of mods. Everything ran fine until yesterday when I started getting CTDs after fast-travelling to Winterhold. The crashes specifically appeared after I finished the quest from the thieves guild to copy the Falmer-Language Stone thingie in Markarth, in case this is somehow relevant. I tried a couple of times and either crashed right after the Loading Screen ended (heard sounds but image. I've released a compatibility patch for JK's Skyrim and Dawn of Skyrim (Director's Cut) combining elements of both mods to make a mega city overhaul. Hi, clueless is used a bit loosely but true here. I know about the basic template regarding where categories should be and to my knowledge I THOUGHT I placed all the mods in their right locations. Evidently I screwed something up. I crash a lot in Whiterun. My game gets stuck at infinite loading screens when I leave the bannered mare and I often just freeze. I hope a pro modded can take a look at my los order and tell me what’s wrong or what mods could be the issue. Thank you, Any help is appre. 
Heya, I've read quite often already that all of those mods \(JK's Skyrim, Open Cities, Immersive Citizens, Immersive Patrols\) I was testing Dawn of Skyrim/JK cities and wandering the vibrant shanty town in Windhelm, and had the idea for a dark elf insurgent/freedom fighter rp.

I know city mods are a frequent subject of inquiry but I'd just like to know if any of you have found setups to truly beef up the size of cities using combinations of mods that play nice together. I tried to supersize Whiterun by slapping a bunch of "Expanded/Enlarged/Engorged Whiterun" mods together and have experienced more than a few overlap issues and CTDs. Have any of you been more successful than I have? EDIT: Lot of you have been suggesting JK and Dawn and while I like how they flesh.
